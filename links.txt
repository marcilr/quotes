Laura Ingalls Wilder
Laura Elizabeth Ingalls Wilder was an American writer known
for the Little House on the Prairie series of children's
books, published between 1932 and 1943, which were based on
her childhood in a settler and pioneer family.  During the
1970s and early 1980s, the television series Little House
on the Prairie was loosely based on the Little House books,
and starred Melissa Gilbert as Laura and Michael Landon as
her father, Charles Ingalls.
